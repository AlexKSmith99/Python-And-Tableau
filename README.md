A Personal Project on Youtube vs. Spotify

In this project, we explore the relationship between Youtube and Spotify as music streamig platforms,  when they were created, and the most popular themes behind these sets.

Acquire the Data:

We got this data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube

We are using the following csvs: sets.csv and themes.csv

Clean the Data:

1. First import your libraries and import the csv files.

2. Next up, let's look at the distribution of our data.

4. Let's check for duplicate rows.
