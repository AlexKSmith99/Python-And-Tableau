A Personal Project on Youtube vs. Spotify

In this project, we explore the relationship between Youtube and Spotify as music streamig platforms,  when they were created, and the most popular themes behind these sets.

Acquire the Data:

We got this data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube

We are using the following csvs: sets.csv and themes.csv

Clean the Data:

1. First import your libraries and import the csv files.

2. Next up, let's look at the distribution of our data.

3. We noticed a null value earlier in the themes dataset. Let's count the nulls.

4. Let's check for duplicate rows.

Explore the Data:

1. Lets see which variables are correlated.

Interesting takeaways:

2. Next, let's examine the distribution of the streams column. Do we have any outliers?

Visualize the Data:

Import CSVs into Tableau Public, link the data sources, create a dashboard with visualizations
